# Co-Creating Act 1 with ChatGPT

### Workshop Goal
Create a compelling story's first act through visual inspiration and AI collaboration.

## Phase 1: Visual Inspiration & Initial Ideas (20 mins)

     - Interesting characters or figures
     - Unique environments or settings
     - Memorable objects or artifacts
     - Distinct mood or atmosphere

2. **Generate Story Seeds**
- Share your images with ChatGPT using this prompt template:
  ```
  I want to create a story inspired by these images. Based on the elements in each image,
  can you propose 3-5 different story concepts?
  For each concept, please include:
  - A working title
  - A brief premise (2-3 sentences)
  - The main conflict or challenge
  ```

3. **Review and Select**
  - Evaluate each proposal based on:
    - Personal connection to the concept
    - Creative potential
    - Feasibility for development
  - Choose one concept to develop further

## Phase 2: Collaborative World-Building
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes

Goal: Establish the foundations of your story, for example, the time/era, the geographic location, the social/cultural context, and the key rules or limitations of the world.

1. **Iterative Development**

  - Use the following prompt template to tell ChatGPT which concept you selected and engage in a Q&A session with ChatGPT:
    ```
    I choose the story concept [replace with your concept number].
    Please ask me 3-4 specific questions to help you create the story's setting.
    Ask me one question at a time.
    ```

## Phase 3: "What If" Exploration

Goal: Explore possible story beginnings and events in your story.

  ```

2. **Path Selection**
