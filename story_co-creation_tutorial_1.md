# Co-Creating Act 1 with ChatGPT

### Workshop Goal
Create a compelling story's first act through visual inspiration and AI collaboration.

### Phase 1: Visual Inspiration & Initial Ideas (20 mins)
1. **Prepare Visual Prompts**
   - Select 3-4 diverse images that contain:
     - Interesting characters or figures
     - Unique environments or settings
     - Memorable objects or artifacts
     - Distinct mood or atmosphere

2. **Generate Story Seeds**
- Share your images with ChatGPT using this prompt template:
  ```
  I want to create a story inspired by these images. Based on the elements in each image,
  can you propose 3-5 different story concepts?
  For each concept, please include:
  - A working title
  - A brief premise (2-3 sentences)
  - The main conflict or challenge
  ```

3. **Review and Select**
  - Evaluate each proposal based on:
    - Personal connection to the concept
    - Creative potential
    - Feasibility for development
  - Choose one concept to develop further

# Phase 2: Collaborative World-Building
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes

Goals: In this step, you will establish the foundations of your story, for example, the time/era, the geographic location, the social/cultural context, and the key rules or limitations of the world.

1. **Iterative Development**

  - Use the following prompt template to tell ChatGPT which concept you selected and engage in a Q&A session with ChatGPT:
    ```
    I select the story concept [replace with your concept number].
    Please ask me 3-4 specific questions to help you create the story's setting.
    Ask me one question at a time.
    ```

3. **Document Development**
  - Keep a running document of:
    - Established facts
    - Open questions
    - Potential conflicts
    - Interesting details for later use

### Phase 3: Design the Inciting Incident (25 mins)
1. **Create the "What If" Moment**
   ```
   What if [element from normal world] suddenly [changes]?
   How would this force our protagonist to act?
   ```

2. **Develop the Hook**
   - Choose one path that:
     - Disrupts the status quo
     - Forces a choice
     - Creates clear stakes

3. **Structure Act 1**
   - Opening scene in normal world
   - Build to inciting incident
   - End with protagonist's first major decision

### Expected Outcome
By workshop end, you should have:
- A clear starting situation
- A defined protagonist
- A compelling inciting incident
- Setup for Act 2

### Quick Tips
