# Co-Creating Act 1 with ChatGPT

### Workshop Goal
Create a compelling first act of a story through visual inspiration and AI collaboration.

### Phase 1: Visual Inspiration & Initial Ideas (20 mins)
1. **Prepare Visual Prompts**
   - Select 3-4 diverse images that contain some of the following:
     - Interesting characters or figures
     - Unique environments or settings
     - Memorable objects or artifacts
     - Distinct mood or atmosphere

2. **Generate Story Seeds**
- Share your images with ChatGPT using this prompt template:
  ```
  I'd like to create a story inspired by these images. Based on the elements in each image,
  can you propose 3-5 different story concepts?
  For each concept, please include:
  - A working title
  - A brief premise (2-3 sentences)
  - The main conflict or challenge
  ```

  3. **Review and Select**
     - Evaluate each proposal based on:
       - Personal connection to the concept
       - Creative potential
       - Feasibility for development
     - Choose one concept to develop further

### Phase 2: World-Building (25 mins)
1. **Establish the "Normal World"**
   - Define 3 key aspects of your protagonist's daily life
   - Ask ChatGPT to suggest common challenges in this world

2. **Deepen the Setting**
   ```
   What underlying tensions or conflicts exist in this world
   that could affect our protagonist's journey?
   ```

3. **Document Critical Elements**
   - Character's routine/status quo
   - World rules/limitations
   - Existing conflicts

### Phase 3: Design the Inciting Incident (25 mins)
1. **Create the "What If" Moment**
   ```
   What if [element from normal world] suddenly [changes]?
   How would this force our protagonist to act?
   ```

2. **Develop the Hook**
   - Choose one path that:
     - Disrupts the status quo
     - Forces a choice
     - Creates clear stakes

3. **Structure Act 1**
   - Opening scene in normal world
   - Build to inciting incident
   - End with protagonist's first major decision

### Expected Outcome
By workshop end, you should have:
- A clear starting situation
- A defined protagonist
- A compelling inciting incident
- Setup for Act 2

### Quick Tips
- Keep your protagonist active, not passive
- Make the stakes personal
- Create clear cause-and-effect
