### Workshop Goals:
- Develop complex character arcs and relationships for your story's second act

## Phase 1: Remember what were your Act 1's events (10 mins)

Goal: Remember what were your Act 1's events.

- Upload your document containing your Act 1 to ChatGPT and use the following template prompt to request a summary of your story.

          Hi! The attached file is a story's 1st act I co-created with you.
          Today, I want to develop the 2nd act with your help.        
          Can you start by providing me with a summary of the events of Act 1?
        

## Phase 2: Main Character Development (10 mins)

Goal: Analyze where your characters are emotionally and physically after Act 1's events. 

- Have an interactive dialogue where ChatGPT takes the lead in the development of your main character. Use this prompt to begin an interactive protagonist analysis and development:

        
        I'd like you to help me analyze my protagonist after Act 1's events through 4-5 guided questions.
        Please:
        1. Ask me focused questions about my protagonist one at a time
        2. Build each question on my previous answer
        3. Look for emotional depth and psychological insights
        4. Help me identify patterns or contradictions in my character's behavior
        5. Summarize what we learned after the last question
        
          
## Phase 3: Supporting Cast Development (10 mins)

Goal: Create compelling interpersonal dynamics that will drive Act 2's conflicts and development.

        Now I'd like you to help me develop the supporting characters through a Q&A session.Please:
        1. List the potential supporting characters and ask me to choose which ones I would like to focus on
        2. Ask 3-4 questions about each supporting character I selected
        2. Ask one question at a time and use my answers to generate follow-up questions
        3. Focus on relationships, motivations, and potential conflicts
        4. If you notice interesting character development opportunities in my answers, explore those further with 1-2 follow-up questions or suggestions
        5. After the last question, summarize what we've learned before asking the next question

## Phase 4: Generate Act 2 (10 mins)

- Use this prompt to create your character-driven second ct:

        Based on our character development work, please generate a draft of Act 2 that shows:
        - How the protagonist struggles with and gradually confronts their main challenge
        - How relationships between the characters evolve or change
        End the act with a moment of personal growth or revelation
        Write it in prose, focusing on character interactions and internal struggles.
